    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I am a fourth-year student currently enrolled at the University of Toronto pursuing a Specialist in Computer Science
      and minors in Mathematics and Statistics. My current research interests span many topics in computer vision (e.g. image
      segmentation, 3D scene understanding), natural language proecessing (language generation, applications to healthcare), 
      and machine learning (e.g. generative modeling, probabilistic modeling, reinforcement learning). Feel free to check out
      the below information about me and also the Projects & Research tab (link) for more details on my work!

    <h1>Experiences</h1>
    <h2>May 2024 - Dec 2024: Hanabi project (CSC494/495 - add link)</h2>
    <p>
      From May to December 2024, I worked with a team of three under the superivion of Professors Alice Gao and Jonathan Calver 
      on a project related to the popular card game Hanabi (add link here). We developed an easily installable
      state-of-the-art game simulator that can be found here (link). Moreover, we also started work on an intelligent
      game-playing agent. More details can be found in the Projects & Reserch page (link).

    </p>
    <h2>May 2023 - Aug 2023: IAI Lab (ROP)</h2>
    <p>
      From May to August 2023, I worked at the Intelligent Adaptive Interventions Lab (add link) as a part of the Research 
      Opportunities Program (add link) at the University of Toronto. At the lab, I assisted several graduate students with their 
      research in human-computer interaction and education. My tasks ranged from programmin (e.g. React, Python), literature
      reviews, and administrative work (e.g. note-taking during meetings, document organization).
      
    </p>
    <h2>Sep 2022 - Apr 2023: UofT MSA</h2>
    <p>
      From September 2022 to April 2023, I led the Department of Religious Education at the University of Toronto Muslim 
      Students' Association. In this role, I organized educational programs, facilitated discussions on faith and personal 
      growth, and worked to create an inclusive environment for a diverse student body. This experience deepened my 
      skills in leadership, event planning, and community building.
