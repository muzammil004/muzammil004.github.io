    <p>
        During the Summer and Fall semesters of 2024, I worked on a research project wiht two other students on the card game
        Hanabi. I took this project as course credit for CSC494/495, and we all worked under the supervision of Professors
        Alice Gao and Jonathan Calver. During the summer, we initially spent most of our time reviewing existing literature 
        related to developing intelligent agents for the game. After realizing most of the current simulators were out-of-date
        or not easy to install and use, we decided to create our own simualtor called HanaSim. In the Fall, we developed our own
        intelligent agent, which was based on an incrementally learning decision tree.

    <h1>Atari Breakout (in assembly)</h1>
    <p>Note: The repository for this project is private (for academic honesty)</p>
    <p>
        I implemented Atari Breakout (link), along with another group member, as a part of the final project in CSC258: 
        Computer Organization (link). All of the code is in assembly using the MIPS Architecture (link). We added two 
        augmentations to the game:
        <ul>
            <li>
                After breaking 15 bricks, the ball won't change directions when it collides with a brick, allowing
                the user to break multiple bricks in one go. This power-up stays for 6 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are two paddles on the screen, with the first being controlled by the "a" (left) and "d" (right) keys,
                and the second being controlled by the "j" (left) and "l" (right) keys.
            </li>
        </ul>
        A video of two games is shown below. <br>
